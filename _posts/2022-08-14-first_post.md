✍️Today I Learned: the post is about I did or learned today.
{: .notice--info}

Finally made a Github blog for the first time. It took me two days but I finally made it. So proud of myself!

I used a Jekyll theme made by [minimal-mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). Directly forked from their github repo. Followed the [guides](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) and watched the youtube videos(link below) for help.

### Should update later List
I've just adjusted the very basic form of the blog and will have to update it a bit more in the future.   

- Search: change it to algolia
- Side bar: As I write more posts, I might need it
- Header, Logo, Default teaser:  
    Definitely want to set one, but I don't want to be bothered with it now since searching for the right photos is quite time-consuming.
- About me: Will have to fill this in
