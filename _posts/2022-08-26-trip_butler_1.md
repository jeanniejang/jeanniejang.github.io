ðŸ’» This series is to record my work through a 6-weeks Spring project at the coding bootcamp.
{: .notice--success}


For the last two weeks, I've been working with the frontend developers, making a basic posting service and cloning instagram.
During those projects, I was quite proud of myself, because I came along a long way, from a person who didn't even know that Java was a language to a person who can make a server that actually works.  
But as I got the grip on what I am doing, the desire to learn beyond "just a working code" became stronger.
I couldn't stop asking myself questions like, "Is this a good code that I'm writing right now?" or "Why am I using this service/server?"
I also wanted to try making other features than the posting service that I've been working on for few weeks now.

So when there was a recruitment for Spring specialized project team, I thought it was a good opportunity to explore Spring in depth and improve my skills.
I applied for the team and starting from today, I am working on a new project with the backend developers.

## Project "Trip Butler"
### Description
Going on a short trip can be very exciting. However, planning a trip is not always easy.
When you get tired of searching where to go, eat or stay, the enthusiasm that you had fades away.
**Trip Butler** started from the idea to make this process simple for people.
If the user just puts in the wanted destination, **Trip Butler** will recommend the user famous tourism sites, restaurants and accommodations around the destination all in one page.
Then user can pick the places she wants to visit and easily make her own travel plan.


### What the team wants to achieve
Until now, I only focused on the functional requirements of the projects.
But for the next 6 weeks, the team will also consider the non-functional requirements, which means the performance of the server such as improvement in response time.
To test the performance later, we will work with large amount of data from different APIs.

Because the purpose of the project is to try improving the server performance, we won't spend much time on the views of our service.

### Functions
1. Social Login - Naver, Kakao, Facebook, Google
2. Search by destination and dates.
3. Show the result by search algorithm (sorted by destination, ratings and reviews)
   - tourism sites
   - restaurants 
   - accommodation 
   - any festivals, events happening in the area

4. Add the places and schedule my trip
5. Users can share their travel plan with other users
6. Users can like and comment on other people's travel plan
