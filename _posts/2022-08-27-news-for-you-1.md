ðŸ’» This series is to record my work through a 6-weeks Spring project at the coding bootcamp.

Some people might be thinking, "what happened to the previous project name? Is this even a same project?"
Well, we had to dump our previous project, which we spent a whole day planning, due to an unexpected issue.

This morning, we looked into the map apis that we planned to use and we found out that saving the map data in our own db for the search was a violation of the api owner's policies.
Which meant that the essential part of our project, giving the tourism site, restaurant and accommodation data based on the user's destination based on the search, is not possible.
So we had to plan on something new.


## Project "News for you"
After a lot of discussion, we finally agreed to keep things simple this time and focus on the search system.
We plan to make a news search system with different filters and keywords.
User can search for the news they are interested and write their thoughts about it.
The purpose of the project is the same as before: work on performance improvement.

### What I learned
When planning, we all thought about the process very vaguely.
For the maps, I just googled if there were the apis and didn't think about it much further after that.
However, from this experience, I learned that I should think more about **how** when planning the project.
